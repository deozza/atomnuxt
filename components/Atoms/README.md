# Atoms

## Add style with custom CSS classes

To customize the look of the atoms according to your graphical chart, you can define custom classes either in the page you are using the atom or in the atom itself.

The first method will keep the custom style only on one page but could be trickier to apply due to the style already applied in the atom. The second method is easier, but you have to keep in mind that this could affect all the places the atom is used in your project.
