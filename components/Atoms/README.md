# Atoms

## Description

An atom is a very small HTML structure that can't be more stripped down without using the basic HTML element itself. An atom comes with its own properties (used to customise its style) and some basic responses to actions.

Most of the time, an atom would compose a molecule. But you can use an atom on its own on a page.

## Available atoms

 * [inputs](./Input/README.md)
 * [link](./Link/README.md)
 * [typography](./Typography/README.md)
 * [button](./Button/README.md)


## Add style with custom CSS classes

To customize the look of the atoms according to your graphical chart, you can define custom classes either in the page you are using the atom or in the atom itself.

The first method will keep the custom style only on one page but could be trickier to apply due to the style already applied in the atom. The second method is easier, but you have to keep in mind that this could affect all the places the atom is used in your project.
